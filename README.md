# API Hacking
This is the base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment.

NB: this repository currently does not contain a `.gitignore` file. I recommend you use https://www.gitignore.io to generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file for your choice of implementation language and development environment.

## Proposal
##Game
I am going to be implementing this componenet for my kivy game.

##Component
The component I want to include into this game would be to use weather databases to affect the weather and colour hue of the game. If the area is cloudy then the colours look grey, if there is rain then rain particles appear on the screen, etc.

##Language
For this I'll be using Python for the colour and weather change and JSON / XML API as this is required to use the API.

##API
The API I'll be using is Open Weather Map which provides free weather data and forecast API suitable for any cartographic services like web and smartphones applications.
