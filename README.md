# API Hacking
This is the base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment.

NB: this repository currently does not contain a `.gitignore` file. I recommend you use https://www.gitignore.io to generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file for your choice of implementation language and development environment.

## Proposal
For my hacking APIs I plan to create a olour tracking system which allows the widget in my kivy app t move dependent on where the colour is detected on screen. The colour will be attached to my controller from my previous hacking project and so the player can move there hand to make the wisget move on screen.
