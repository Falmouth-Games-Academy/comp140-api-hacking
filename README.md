# API Hacking
This is the base repository for the COMP140 API Hacking assignment.

NB: this repository current does not contain a `.gitignore` file. I recommend you use https://www.gitignore.io to generate an appropriate `.gitignore` file for your choice of implementation language and development environment.

## Proposal

The component I intend to make will be for the COMP150 game, it will get the player's friend list from facebook and then name the ingame characters after there friends. A stretch goal maybe to make the characters speak their namesakes facebook posts.  

####User stories in the form of a Trello task board;  

####Identify and justify which technologies (implementation language, APIs, etc.) you will use:
Facebook have their own API, [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api), that allows the user read the friends list of a specified person if they have the right ID/token.
